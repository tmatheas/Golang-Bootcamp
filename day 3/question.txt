Import data from a CSV file which contains information related to books(title, author, genre, publisher) and later print it on console. Use TDD while solving this problem and check for code coverage.

You can use the "os.Open" function to open the file(hint: os.Open returns a file type which implements io.Reader) and the "encoding/csv" package in golang to import csv data.
